;; Warning: Starting with Emacs 26, Emacs contains builtin functionality to
;; support OSC 52.  Avoid loading osc52.el under Emacs 26 or later, as it will
;; stomp over that functionality.  If copying to the clipboard doesn’t work out
;; of the box, customize the variable ‘xterm-extra-capabilities.’
;;
;; This script can be loaded during emacs initialization to automatically
;; send `kill-region' and `kill-ring-save' regions to your system clipboard.
;; The OSC 52 terminal escape sequence is used to transfer the selection from
;; emacs to the host terminal.
;;
;; It works in hterm, xterm, and other terminal emulators which support the
;; sequence.
;;
;; It also works under screen, via the `osc52-select-text-dcs' defined below, as
;; long as the outer terminal supports OSC 52.
;;
;; It doesn't work under tmux.  Tmux consumes the OSC 52 sequence and doesn't
;; use the DSC sequence as a pass-through to the host terminal.  Please feel
;; free to submit patches.
