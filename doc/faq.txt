                            hterm and  Secure Shell
                          Frequently  Asked Questions

                                April 25,  2012


Hello World.  This is the hterm/Secure Shell FAQ.  If you have a question that
is not answered here, please ask it on the chromium-hterm mailing list located
at <http://goo.gl/RYHiK>.


> What is "Secure Shell"?

  Secure Shell is a Chrome Application that combines the "ssh" command (see
  http://openssh.org/ for details) ported to NativeClient with the "hterm"
  terminal emulator to provide a secure shell client for the Chrome browser.

  Secure Shell provides similar functionality to PuTTY on Microsoft Windows(c)
  systems, and the ssh command-line application on Mac OS X and Linux systems.


> What is "hterm"?

  "HTML Terminal", or hterm, is an xterm-compatible terminal emulator written
  entirely in JavaScript.

  It is intended to be fast enough and correct enough to compete with native
  terminals such as xterm, gnome-terminal, konsole and Terminal.app.

  hterm is only a terminal emulator.  It does not provide SSH access (or any
  other text-based command) on its own.


> How do Secure Shell and hterm relate to the "crosh" (Ctrl-Alt-T) command in
  Chrome OS?

  See chromeos-crosh.txt in this directory for the details.

  TL;DR - Don't use crosh for ssh any more, use the Secure Shell app instead.
  The crosh shell will use the newer terminal emulator from Secure Shell when
  possible.


> How do hterm and Secure Shell differ from existing web terminals?

  hterm stands out from many existing web terminals in that it was built from
  the start to match the performance and correctness of "native" terminals such
  as xterm and Terminal.app.  It expects to be your main terminal.

  This means it can handle large bursts of text quickly, support very large
  scrollback buffers, and it closely matches xterm's behavior (but there's
  a few fixes left here).

  The Secure Shell app is different because it does not require a proxy or
  relay server to function.  Secure Shell can make a direct connection to
  a standard sshd server on any port of the destination machine.  Other
  web terminals require a proxy server in the middle.  In some cases you
  are even required to hand the proxy your credentials in plain text.


> Is my data sent through Google's (or anyone else's) servers?

  No.  By default all connections are made directly to the sshd server on the
  destination machine.


> Can I make SSH connections over HTTP?

  Sort of.  Secure Shell comes with the ability to use an HTTP based relay
  server.  The connection setup and read/write protocol was built inside
  Google to facilitate secure access by Google employees.  You can read the
  source and documentation in the google_relay.js file for the details.

  The Google relay server expects that traffic is encrypted by the client and
  server.  This means it would be very difficult for the relay to perform a
  "Man In The Middle" attack.  It also supports a single-signon step during
  connection setup.

  The relay source is not public, but you're free to build one that works the
  same way.  There should be enough documentation in google_relay.js to
  reverse engineer a compatible relay.

  Secure Shell is set up to accept pluggable relay libraries.   If there were
  an agreed-upon open relay protocol, Secure Shell could add support for it
  without much overhead work.


> Is my connection really secure?

  The Secure Shell app uses ssh to manage the encrypted communication channels.
  This makes it about as secure as any other connection based on the ssh
  command.

  It does have the added advantage of running ssh as a sandboxed
  Native Client plugin, which in theory makes it more secure than an
  unsandboxed ssh connection.

  Additionally, the Secure Shell application follows a strict Content Security
  Policy that does not allow access to the JavaScript 'eval' function.  This
  helps lower the risk that a terminal exploit could run arbitrary JavaScript.


> What should I do if I notice a bug?

  First, please continue reading this FAQ to make sure your issue isn't
  mentioned.  Then check the bug list at <http://goo.gl/hpqWk>.

  If you don't see the issue there, you can search the archives of the
  chromium-hterm mailing list here: <http://goo.gl/RYHiK>.

  If all else fails then join the chromium-hterm mailing list and post
  about what you've found.

  If your bug involves some mis-interpreted escape sequence and you want
  to file a really useful bug report, then add in a recording of the
  session.  For bonus points, track down the troublesome sequence and
  incude the offset into the log file.  For more information about how to
  do this, see the "Debugging escape sequences" section in the hack.txt file
  in this directory.


> Is there a mailing list to discuss hterm or Secure Shell?

  Yes, the public chromium-hterm mailing list is here: <http://goo.gl/RYHiK>.


> Can I connect using a keypair or certificate?

  Sorry, not yet.  We're working on it though.  Join the chromium-hterm
  mailing list if you want to be notified when it's ready.


> How do I set terminal preferences?

  The Secure Shell application does not currently have a preferences page.
  It's in the works, and will be available before Secure Shell leaves
  "beta" status.  For now, you need to open the JavaScript console to
  change the user preferences.  Sorry about that.

  In general, you open the JavaScript console and type something like...

     term_.prefs_.set('pref-name', 'pref-value')

  Preferences are saved in your local storage, so they're remembered the
  next time you launch Secure Shell.

  If you want to check the current value of a preference, type this...

     term_.prefs_.get('pref-name')

  To reset a single preference to its default state, type this...

     term_.prefs_.reset('pref-name')

  To reset all preferences to their default state, type this...

     localStorage.clear()

  Most preference changes take effect immediately, in all open instances of
  Secure Shell.  The exception is the 'environment' setting, which won't
  take effect until the next time you reconnect.

  Some common preferences are listed in questions that follow.  For the full
  list, you'll have to read through the "setProfile" function in terminal.js.
  It's here: <http://goo.gl/FDEXb>, around line 130.


> How do I change the audible bell sound?

  Open the JavaScript console and type...

     term_.prefs_.set('audible-bell-sound', 'http://example.com/bell.ogg')

  Change the example url to point to the sound file you want to use.
  Unfortunately, local file: urls are not supported at this time.  If you
  want to get fancy you could construct a data: url, but the details of
  that are beyond the scope of this FAQ.


> How do I disable the audible bell?

  Open the JavaScript console and type...

     term_.prefs_.set('audible-bell-sound', '')


> How do I change the color scheme?

  You can change the foreground, background or cursor color preferences from
  the JavaScript console like this...

     term_.prefs_.set('background-color', 'wheat')
     term_.prefs_.set('foreground-color', '#533300')
     term_.prefs_.set('cursor-color', 'rgba(100, 100, 10, 0.5)')

  You can use any valid CSS color value for any of these colors.  You need
  to use a semi-transparent color (the fourth parameter in the rgba value)
  for the cursor if you want to be able to see the character behind it.


> How do I change the font face?

  Open the JavaScript console and type...

     term_.prefs_.set('font-family', 'Lucida Console')

  Replace 'Lucida Console' with your favorite monospace font.

  Keep in mind that some fonts, especially on Mac OS X systems, have bold
  characters that are larger than the non-bold version.  hterm will print a
  warning to the JS console if it detects that you've selected a font like
  this.  It will also disable "real" bold characters, using only bright
  colors to indicate bold.


> How to I change the default font size?

  Open the JavaScript console and type...

     term_.prefs_.set('font-size', 15)

  Replace 15 with your desired font size in pixels.  15 is the default, so
  you'll have to pick a different number to have any effect at all.


> Can I quickly make temporarily changes to the font size?

  Yes.  The Ctrl-Plus, Ctrl-Minus and Ctrl-Zero keys can increase, decrease,
  or reset the current font size.  This zoomed size is not remembered the
  next time you start hterm.  See the previous question if you want something
  that will stick.

  It's useful to know that hterm has to handle font zooming on its own.
  Without interference from the browser's built-in zoom function.

  The browser zoom introduces rounding errors in pixel measurements that
  make it difficult (maybe impossible) for hterm to accurately position the
  cursor on the screen.  (It could do a little better than it does but
  probably not enough to be worth the effort.)

  To mitigate this, hterm will display a warning message when your browser
  zoom is not 100%.  In this mode the Ctrl-Plus, Ctrl-Minus and Ctrl-Zero
  keys are passed directly to the browser.  Just press Ctrl-Zero to reset your
  zoom and dismiss the warning.

  hterm should start handling Ctrl-Plus, Ctrl-Minus and Ctrl-Zero on its
  own once your zoom setting is fixed.


> Why do I get a warning about my browser zoom?

  Because hterm requires you to set your browser to 100%, or 1:1 zoom.
  Try Ctrl-Zero or the Wrench->Zoom menu to reset your browser zoom.  The
  warning should go away after you correct the zoom level.

  See the previous question for more information.


> How do I disable anti-alaising?

  Open the JavaScript console and type...

     term_.prefs_.set('font-smoothing', 'none')

  This directly modifies the '-webkit-font-smoothing' CSS property for the
  terminal.  As such, 'none', 'antialiased', and 'subpixel-antialiased' are
  all valid values.

  The default setting is 'antialiased'.


> How do I make the cursor blink?

  Open the JavaScript console and type...

     term_.prefs_.set('cursor-blink', true)

  Notice that true is NOT in quotes.  This is especially important if you try
  to turn blinking back off, with...

     term_.prefs_.set('cursor-blink', false)

  or you could just revert to the default value of false with...

     term_.prefs_.reset('cursor-blink')


> How do I change the TERM environment variable?

  Open the JavaScript console and type...

     term_.prefs_.set('environment', {TERM: 'hterm'})

  Notice that only 'hterm' is quoted, not the entire value.  You can replace
  'hterm' with whichever value you prefer.

  The default TERM value is 'xterm-256color'.  If you prefer to simulate a
  16 color xterm, try setting TERM to 'xterm'.

  You will have to reconnect for this setting to take effect.


> How do I enter accented characters?

  That depends on your platform and which accented characters you want to
  enter.

  In xterm, you could use Alt-plus-a-letter-or-number to select from the
  upper 128 characters.  The palette of 128 characters was "hardcoded" and
  not dependent on your keyboard locale.  You can set hterm to do the same
  thing by opening the JavaScript console and typing...

     term_.prefs_.set('alt-sends-what', '8-bit')

  However, if you are on Mac OS X and you prefer that Alt sends a character
  based on your keyboard locale, try this instead...

     term_.prefs_.set('alt-sends-what', 'browser-key')

  Note that composed characters (those that require multiple keystrokes) are
  not currently supported by this mode.

  If you are running Chrome OS on a Chromebook you can select your keyboard
  locale from the system settings and just use the Right-Alt (the small one,
  on the right) to enter accented characters.  No need to change the
  'alt-sends-what' preference at all.

  The default value for 'alt-sends-what' is 'escape'.  This makes Alt work
  mostly like a traditional Meta key.

  If you really, really want Alt to be an alias for the Meta key in every
  sense, use...

     term_.prefs_.set('alt-is-meta', true)


> How do I make backspace send ^H?

  By default, hterm sends a delete (DEL, '\x7f') character for the
  backspace key.  Sounds crazy, but it tends to be the right thing for
  most people.  If you'd prefer it send the backspace (BS, '\x08', aka ^H)
  character, then open the JavaScript console and type...

     term_.prefs_.set('backspace-sends-backspace', true)


> How do I remove a known hosts entry?

  If you know the index of the offending host entry (it's usually reported
  by ssh if the connection fails) you can open the JavaScript console and
  type...

     term_.command.removeKnownHostByIndex(index)

  Replace index with the numeric, one-based host index.

  If you don't know the index, or you'd like to clear all known hosts,
  type...

     term_.command.removeAllKnownHosts()


> How do I send Ctrl-W, Ctrl-N or Ctrl-T to the terminal?

  Chrome blocks tab contents from getting access to these (and a few other)
  keys.  You can open Secure Shell in a dedicated window to get around
  this limitation.  Just right-click on the Secure Shell icon and enable
  "Open as Window".

  After that, any time you launch Secure Shell it will open in a new window
  and respond properly to these accelerator keys.

  If you're running in Chrome OS you may notice that Ctrl-N, Ctrl-Space
  and a few other keys are reserved by the new window manager.  This is
  a known issue tracked by <http://crbug.com/123856>.


> How do I copy text from the terminal?

  Under Mac OS X the normal Command-C sequence can be used to copy the current
  selection to the clipboard.

  On other platforms Ctrl-C will perform a Copy only when text is selected.
  When there is no current selection Ctrl-C will send a "^C" to the host.

  Note that after copying text to the clipboard the active selection will be
  cleared.  If you happen to have text selected but want to send "^C",
  just hit Ctrl-C twice.

  Under X11, highlighted text is automatically added to the X clipboard.
  However, due to an hterm limitation, text that is scrolled off screen is
  not included.

  Under all platforms (except Chrome OS, due to http://crosbug.com/29343) you
  can also use the "Copy" command from the Wrench menu.


> How do I paste text to the terminal?

  Under Mac OS X the normal Command-V sequence can be used to paste from
  the clipboard.

  On other platforms use Ctrl-Shift-V to paste from the clipboard.

  Under X11, you can use middle-mouse-click to paste from the X clipboard.

  Under all platforms (except Chrome OS, due to http://crosbug.com/29343) you
  can also use the "Paste" command from the Wrench menu.


> Why does the cursor blink in emacs?

  Do you normally use Terminal.app or xterm?  Those terminals (and probably
  a few others) ignore the "ESC [ ? 12 h" and "ESC [ ? 12 l" sequences.
  Emacs uses these sequences (on purpose) to enable and disable cursor blink.

  If you prefer a steady cursor in emacs, set visible-cursor to nil as
  described in <http://goo.gl/i9THb>.


> Why does the color scheme look funny in emacs/vi/vim?

  hterm's default value for the TERM environment variable is
  'xterm-256color'.  This causes emacs, vi, and some other programs to
  use a different color palette than when TERM='xterm'.

  You may notice these programs use a font color that is difficult to read
  over a dark background (such as dark blue).

  You can fix vi with ':set bg=dark'.  Emacs can be started in "reverse
  video" mode with 'emacs -rv'.

  If you just want your old 16 color palette back, open the JavaScript
  console and type...

     term_.prefs_.set('environment', {TERM: 'xterm'})

  Then restart Secure Shell.


> Where is the source code?

  The hterm source is here: <http://goo.gl/EqrV0>.  This includes the
  front-end code for Secure Shell.

  The Native Client wrapper around ssh is here: <http://goo.gl/760JC>.


> Is there a change log?

  Yes.  Look under the doc/ directory of the hterm source.

  There are two change logs.  One shows changes to the development version
  of Secure Shell.  The other shows stable releases.

  In general, the dev series of the form 0.X.Y.Z becomes the stable
  version 0.X.Y.  So SecureShell-dev-0.7.2.0, 0.7.2.1 and 0.7.2.2 all lead up
  to SecureShell-0.7.2.


> What if I want to make changes to the source?

  Read the hack.txt file in this directory.
